# Tunisia-Flight-Delay-Prediction-Project

## Description
The aim of the project is to predict the estimated duration of flight delays per flight. 
These insights will assist in giving a detailed analysis of the performance of individual airlines, airports, and then making a well-assessed decision. Moreover, apart from the assessment related to the passengers, delay prediction analysis will also help in important decision-making procedures necessary for every pivotal player in the air transportation system.


## Experimental Design


The following are the steps that we will take to conduct this project. They are listed below:


* loading the required libraries
* loading the data set
* check the data
* data preparation
* validate the data
* performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
* fit the data 
* train the models
* make predictions using the various models
* evaluate the performance of the models
* draw conclusions
* make recommendations
